This assignment had us implement a Hash Map (hashMap.c) which is then used for our Concordance program (main.c). 
The Concordance program takes a file as input from the command line and counts the occurance of each word in the file.

To run, copy each of the provided files into your directory and type:
$ make all
$ prog <filename>          e.g. - $ prog inputFile1.txt
 
where <filename> is the name of a file that you want to use.
The results will be printed to the console. 

You can run tests with:
$ tests

For cleanup:
$ make clean
